Description: Algorithmic experimental designs. Calculates exact and
        approximate theory experimental designs for D,A, and I
        criteria. Very large designs may be created. Experimental
        designs may be blocked or blocked designs created from a
        candidate list, using several criteria.  The blocking can be
        done when whole and within plot factors interact.
